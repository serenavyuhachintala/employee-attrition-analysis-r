# Employee Attrition Analysis in R
By Serena Vyusha Chintala

This project explores key factors contributing to employee attrition using R and a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to help HR and management teams understand patterns in employee turnover and develop data-driven retention strategies.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Employee Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelprashant/employee-attrition)
- **Records:** 1,470 employees
- **Features:** 19 columns including age, job role, department, income, overtime, tenure, and attrition status

---

## Business Problem

High attrition can result in major losses to productivity, hiring costs, and morale. This analysis answers:

- What demographic or job-related factors are most linked to attrition?
- Are there specific departments or job roles more affected?
- How do overtime, salary hikes, and tenure influence turnover?

---

## Tools & Packages Used

- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `ggcorrplot`

---

## Visualizations & Key Findings

### Age vs. Attrition
- Highest attrition observed between **ages 25 to 40**
- Younger employees are more likely to leave

---

### Department-Level Churn
- **Sales** department see the highest attrition
- Job roles within departments influence turnover rates

---

### Overtime Impact
- Employees working overtime are **significantly more likely** to quit

---

### Tenure and Attrition
- Longer tenure reduces churn risk
- New employees are more likely to leave early on

### Correlation Matrix
- Strong positive relationships:
  - `JobLevel` â†” `MonthlyIncome` (0.95)
  - `TotalWorkingYears` â†” `YearsAtCompany`
- Salary hike and performance rating also correlate well

## Recommendations

- Improve onboarding and engagement for employees aged **25â€“40**
- Reevaluate overtime policies to reduce burnout
- Encourage career progression to reduce early exits
- Offer meaningful salary hikes tied to performance
- Strengthen manager-employee relationships (shown to reduce attrition)
